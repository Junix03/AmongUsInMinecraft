At this moment its not possible to play this game

## How to set up your server

1. Create or rent a paper, bukkit or spigot server
   
2. Put the delivered plugin into the plugins-folder

3. Put the delivered worlds "lobby", "skeld", "mira" and "polus" onto the root of the server where the standard worlds are

4. Start the server and play the game :D
